The purpose of this project is to manipulate C-Style strings. We will do so by making functions that check and count different aspects of the string as well as changing the case of the characters. 

We just finished all the functions and pushed them into GitHub.

text_utility.h is the header file including the declarations of the functions.

text_utility.cpp is the source file which has the implementations of all the functions.

main.cpp is the source file which demonstrates each function by using examples that include empty strings, different case letters and special characters.

You can build this library and use it by using a C++ compiler like g++ which we took in class previously. 

You compile it by calling g++ main.cpp text_utility.cpp

We will use Cmake to build the file.
